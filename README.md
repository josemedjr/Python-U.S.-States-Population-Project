## Web Scraping and Data Analysis on U.S. States Population using Python

## Problem Description
I utilized Beautiful Soup and web scraping techniques in Python to extract population data of U.S. states from different decades from Wikipedia. After collecting the data, I employed Pandas to structure it into a table and carried out data cleaning to improve its usability. With the cleaned data, I conducted a thorough analysis and developed visualizations to identify patterns in the population changes of U.S. states over different decades, with a focus on regional trends.
